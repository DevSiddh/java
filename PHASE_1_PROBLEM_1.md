You are helping a student launch the first version of a Console Budget Tracker.

A user wants to quickly check whether they have money left after one income and one expense.

Your task is to build a tiny console interaction where the user:
- enters their monthly income amount,
- enters one expense amount,
- sees a clear message showing their remaining balance.

Focus on one concept only: using variables to store numeric values and calculate a result.

Do not add categories, menus, loops, or validation yet—this first step is only about storing values and computing balance.

Now write Java code that solves this problem in the console.
